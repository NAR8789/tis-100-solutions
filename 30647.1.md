Don't think this can be improved further... node 6 is the bottleneck, and its operation seems atomic.

Atomic... but not minimal! I've found a solution to the uneven branch problem! By duplicating the logic up to the branch point, we can avoid the cycle cost of the extra JMP instruction in the leading branch
