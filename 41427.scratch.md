## pseudocode

### find-max, without bounds

```
acc = 0
tmp = next()
if tmp > acc {
  acc = tmp
}
```

elt1
elt2
elt3

diffmax
1
diffmax
2
diffmax
3

acc = next()
if acc > 0 {
  next()
} else {
  acc + next()
}

### find-min, without bounds
```
acc = 999
tmp = next()
if tmp < acc {
  acc = tmp
}
```

or, if given

diffmin
elt1
diffmin
elt2
diffmin
elt3

acc = next()
if acc < 0 {
  next()
} else {
  acc + next()
}

mov in acc
jlz k
r: add in
mov acc out

mov in acc
jgz r
k: mov in out

## find-max twice, chained...

```
stream ------------------------------+
    |                                |
    |                                V
    +---> find and output max -> gated output -+--> out (max)
    |      |                         |         |
    |      V                         |         V
    +---> max - stream               |        subtract --> out (min)
           |                         |         A
           V                         V         |
          find and ouptut max -> gated output -+
``` 

alterntately...

```
stream ------------------------------+
    |                                |
    |                                V
    +---> find and output max -> gated output ----> out (max)
    |      |                         |
    |      V                         V
    +---> find and ouptut min -> gated output ----> out (min)
``` 

need to design...
- find and output max(/min)
  - also need to reset on 0 (this may be a problem)
- gated output
