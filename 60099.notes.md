So... the problem is, I need three read heads to get this to work.

A single window filter is easy:
- run two read heads
- Sum the first three values on the first head, incrementing at each step
- Then, alternately sum from the first head and subtract from the second head, incrementing at each step

Two windows is trickier... naively, I need three read heads
- run two sums on the leading read head
- trail one read head by three for subtracting, to get the 3-window
- trail one read head by five for subtracting, to get the 5-window

My queue implementation is huge, and only gives me one additional read head.

Naively, I tried to bring the two trailing read heads in sync, but this just revealed that my leading two read would need to be de-synced, to remain 3 ahead and 5 ahead. In the end, I was still trying to cram 3 read heads of work onto two read heads.

A de-sync of two might be achieveable by using bak registers

### Solution:

Figured out in paper journal:
- use queueing to get a leading head at 0 and a trailing head at 3
- use some kind of delay line to get an additional trailing head at 4
- use addhead-subtail to get the 3-window at [0,3)
- use the list doubling trick to get a 2-window at [3,4], from the head at 4
- get the 5-window by adding [0,3) + [3,4]

### Alternate Solution:

Iterate list-doubling, layering together 2-windows, to get "binomial shingles"

```
  1 1
+   1 1
-------
  1 2 1
```

Then find the 3-window and 5-window as linear combinations of binomial shingles

```
|1|   |0|   |1|
|2| - |1| = |1|
|1|   |0|   |1|
```

```
|1|     |0|   |0|   |1|
|4|     |1|   |0|   |1|
|6| - 3 |2| + |1| = |1|
|4|     |1|   |0|   |1|
|1|     |0|   |0|   |1|
```

This still needs 3 read heads, but their positions are 0,1,2. Feels much more achievable via traditional delay line tactics.

Sidenote: Somehow this solution produces a 5-shingle and a 3-shingle with common center (and thus a leading-edge-lag of 1), rather than the 3-head addhead-subtail approach, which tended to produce a leading-edge-lag of either 0 or 2. 

Both the leading-edge-lag and the head separation are interesting. The head separation is much shorter with binomial shingles. A span of 2 is much nicer than a span of 3 or 4 or 5
