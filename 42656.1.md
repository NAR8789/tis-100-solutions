The synchronization code on this somehow works but is fairly incomprehensible to me. I'm going to document it here in an attempt to make it feel more structured.

## Enumeration of Synchronization "Wires"

The synchronization wiring is somewhat well behaved in that a blocking read or write in one node always corresponds to a blocking write or read in the appropriate adjacent node. As such, I am able to label all the individual "wires". I have done so with comments in the code. They are:
- `A1`
- `B1`
- `B2`
- `B3`
- `A0`

### `A1`

``` TIS-100
@1
MOV 0 DOWN

@4
MOV UP RIGHT

@5
MOV LEFT NIL
```

`A1` prevents reads from the top stack by `@5` until `@1` finishes writing to the top stack.

`A1` also prevents (in conjunction with `A0`) writes to the bottom stack by `@4` before `@7` is done reading from the bottom stack. This function is somewhat subtle--writes to bottom require two wiring steps, one in node `@1` and one in node `@4`. `A1` does not block in `@1` in this case, but does block in `@4`.

The subtlety here was accidental--the original intent of the `A1` wiring was to serve as a bidirectional sync across all three nodes. In reality, `@5` waits for `@4` waits for `@1`, and `@4` waits for `@5`, but `@1` does not wait for `@4`.

### `A0`

In conjunction with `A1`, `A0` prevents writes to the bottom stack by `@4` before `@7` finishes reading from the bottom stack.

### `B1` and `B2`

``` TIS-100
@1
MOV 0 DOWN #B2

@4
MOV 0 RIGHT #B1
MOV UP NIL #B2

@5
MOV LEFT NIL #B1
```

`B1` and `B2` prevent node `@1` from writing to top stack before node `@5` is done reading from top stack.

### `B1` and `B3`

``` TIS-100
@4
MOV 0 RIGHT #B1

@5
MOV LEFT NIL #B1
MOV 0 DOWN #B3

@7
MOV UP NIL #B3
```

`B1` and `B3` prevent node `@7` from reading from bottom stack before node `@4` is done writing to bottom stack

The case of `@7` reading from bottom stack before `@4` is done writing is not checked by the fixed test cases. As such, it's possible to drop `#B3` and still pass (nondeterministically), with a slightly faster cycle count.

### Revision of `B1` and `B3`

The wiring of `B1` and `B3` can be rewritten like `A1`, to provide a speedup of 1 instruction over the test sets.

``` TIS-100
@4
MOV 0 RIGHT

@5
MOV LEFT DOWN

@7
MOV UP NIL
```

## Enumeration of Stack Synchronization Error Cases

To really cover our bases, we can consider stack synchronization errors from a high level, and make sure all potential synchronization error cases are covered. These are:
- `@5` reads from top stack before `@1` finishes writing
  - covered by `A1`
- `@1` writes to top stack before `@5` finishes reading
  - covered by `B1`-`B2`
- `@7` reads from bottom stack before `@4` finishes writing
  - covered by `B1`-`B3` (or, in revision, `B1`)
- `@4` writes to bottom stack before `@7` finishes reading
  - covered by `A0`-`A1`
